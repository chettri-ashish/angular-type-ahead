# Angular-Type-Ahead
Type Ahead Created in Angular JS -

This type ahead allows the control to fetch data based on user keystrokes. It displays the results in a dynamically changing list based on 
user input. It supports full keyboard navigation. 

This control was created to provide an alternative to downloading the full ui bootstrap package. This type ahead directive is really easy to customize.

Feedback is appreciated.
